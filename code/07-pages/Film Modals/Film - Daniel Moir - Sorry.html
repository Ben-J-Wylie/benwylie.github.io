        <h3>Synopsis</h3>
      </div>
      <p>
        In this captivating music video, we follow a man as he sits down with
        his guitar, ready to write a song. However, he’s faced with the
        frustrating challenge of creative writer's block. <br />
        <br />
        As he reflects in a pensive moment, he abandons the paper in front of
        him and begins to draw on his hand, an unexpected outlet for his
        creativity. <br />
        <br />
        The video takes us on a journey as he continues drawing on his arm, his
        guitar, and even a snare drum, transforming them into vibrant canvases.
        As the colors intensify, so does his creative flow—he brings out paints
        and covers his instruments in bold, expressive designs. <br />
        <br />
        By the end of the video, both he and his instruments are completely
        drenched in paint, symbolizing the release of his creativity and the
        abundance of inspiration that follows.
