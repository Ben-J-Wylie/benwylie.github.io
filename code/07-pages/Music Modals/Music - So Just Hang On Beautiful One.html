        <h3>Synopsis</h3>
      </div>
      <p>
        “I do not fear death. I had been dead for billions and billions of years
        before I was born, and had not suffered the slightest inconvenience from
        it.” ~Mark Twain
      </p>
      <p>
        This may very well be the case for Mark Twain, but for the young man in
        this story the sentiment is quite different…
      </p>
      <p>
        Having once cherished the beliefs he held as a child, the young man now
        finds himself at a stage in life where these cherished beliefs are
        beginning to melt away. He loses his faith in the existence of heaven
        and an afterlife, and is left staring into face of ‘nothingness beyond
        the grave.’
      </p>
      <p>
        In a moment of existential desperation the young man imagines that even
        an eternity of suffering and torment in hell would be preferable to
        utter annihilation. Though hell would present an existence of
        unimaginable pain, it would be ‘existence’ non-the-less.
      </p>
      <p>
        In his dream, the young man sneaks in through hell’s ominous gates.
        Having no official passport visa for entrance to the shadowy domain, he
        is careful to slip unseen past the devilish border guards. But just as
        the thinks his stealth to be a success, he feels the cold and forceful
        grip of a guard’s boney hand on his shoulder. It is explained to the
        young man that without a belief in the existence of Heaven, he forfeits
        his privilege to reside there, and that Hell operates by the same rules.
        You simply don’t get to stay if you don’t believe.
      </p>
      <p>
        With one final maddened attempt, the young man rushes past the guards
        but they subdue him. With blood streaming from his nose, he pleads with
        the devils to accept his entrance, but they throw him out and lock the
        gates behind them.
      </p>
      <p>
        As the broken man heads home to live his remaining days, he hears warm
        voices reassuring him that before he was born, everything was okay, and
        that such will be the same after he is gone.
