        <h3>Synopsis</h3>
      </div>
      <p>
        This song tells the story of a misanthropic glass artist ‘Sir Nothing
        Nor Anything’ who fashions the most beautiful glass sculpture that ever
        was; a gorgeous ballerina standing on point. Becoming obsessed with his
        new creation, he locks himself in his home, closes his blinds and shuts
        out the world so as not to disturb his infatuated gaze. He watches as
        the light from the fireplace refracts through the curves of his beloved
        figurine.
      </p>
      <p>
        Angered by his seclusion, the people of the town dawn their pitchforks
        and torches, and proceed to break down the door in order to hold the man
        to account.
      </p>
      <p>
        Fearing that the mob will steal his cherished ballerina he climbs to the
        roof for safety. But upon arriving there, and seeing he has no escape,
        he leaps to his death.
      </p>
      <p>
        With him, having a broken heart, and her, having shattered into a
        thousand pieces, in the final moments as they plummet to their death, we
        find the man consuming as many broken shards of glass as he can that
        they might rest together as one.
