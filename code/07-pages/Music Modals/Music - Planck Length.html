        <h3>Synopsis</h3>
      </div>
      <p>
        A man wakes up and notices that his is wearing a torn shirt. For all his
        efforts he can’t remember how his shirt came to be in such a disheveled
        state, nor can he remember how he even came to exist in the first place.
        Burrowing deep into the recesses of his mind, the man tries to summon
        any memory what-so-ever, even to the point of reaching for memories from
        before his own birth.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sitting in the shower he watches the falling water and ponders the
        nature of the experience. Perhaps this experience is just a dream, or
        perhaps this experience isn’t anything at all.
      </p>
      <p>
        Heading out into the rain, the man hops the train and makes his way
        across town for reasons of no particular consequence to anyone, or
        himself. But as he sits starring out the window at the cityscape
        streaming by, he sees some graffiti on an ally wall and leaves the train
        to read it.
      </p>
      <p>
        In a perfunctory and still dripping font, it reads, “If you’re not big,
        then maybe your small.”
      </p>
      <p>
        Standing there dripping in the rain, man considers the words. He wonders
        if they might provide some insight into who he is or what he is
        experiencing. In a philosophical frenzy, one by one the man rules out
        his ‘self’ as being contingent upon either one of his body, his brain,
        or his personality. Ultimately he concludes that if there is in fact a
        self at all, it’s smaller that the shortest unit of length… a self far
        less than physical or theoretical observation. A self smaller than
        Planck Length.
