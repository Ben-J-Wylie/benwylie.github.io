        <h3>Synopsis</h3>
      </div>
      <p>
        With one goal on his mind, the determined young man in this story
        gathers his shovel and pick, and heads out to start digging. The layers
        of loam hold all manner of element, and as the man descends strata by
        strata, he embarks on his journey into a deep and ancient earth.
      </p>
      <p>
        The sands and clays of the earth render untold varieties of precious
        stones, gems, and geodes, enough to make any man richer beyond their
        wildest imaginations, but the young man discards them all. There is only
        one thing that he seeks, and that is crystallized love.
      </p>
      <p>
        The young man had heard that ‘love in crystal form’ existed in caverns
        deep beneath the layers in which other riches might be found. Most
        people who search for this alleged crystal love are waylaid by the
        bounty they encounter on the way, only to forget their original goal.
        And so, they leave the love hidden and locked deep with the earth.
      </p>
      <p>
        But our man digs on. Months, years and even decades pass, but on he
        digs. Deeper and deeper he burrows until the sunlight fades, not only
        from view, but from his memory as well.
      </p>
      <p>
        In a moment of rest, the man hears a rumbling from deep within the earth
        and the ground gives way. He tumbles down into a deep dark cavern where,
        upon regaining his consciousness, he sees that he is surrounded by
        mountains and valleys of crystallized love.
