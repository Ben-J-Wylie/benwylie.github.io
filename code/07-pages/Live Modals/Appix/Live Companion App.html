        <h3>Project Scope</h3>
      </div>
      <p>
        In 2016, APPIX Technologies Inc. introduced a groundbreaking mobile app
        designed to enhance live production experiences by allowing operators to
        control phone functions in real time—without requiring cellular data or
        Wi-Fi. This innovation created a new paradigm for audience engagement,
        unlocking immersive possibilities at concerts, sporting events, and
        public gatherings. Building on this success, in 2021, APPIX expanded its
        capabilities by introducing a web socket version of its control system,
        enabling live producers to manage second-screen interactions seamlessly.
        This advancement not only broadened accessibility but also solidified
        APPIX as a leader in live event technology. With its unique transmission
        technology and niche market positioning, APPIX required a tailored
        approach to design, implementation, and integration to ensure seamless
        functionality across diverse live event environments.

        <h3>Our Approach</h3>
      </div>
      <p>
        Rather than developing a one-size-fits-all platform, APPIX adopted a
        bespoke approach, crafting both the core app experience and customized
        solutions for each client. This led to a new, distinct department in
        live production focused exclusively on audience interactivity through
        mobile technology. Key Innovations: Custom Integration for Each Event:
        APPIX worked closely with producers, lighting designers, and event
        organizers to synchronize audience participation with live performances.
        Seamless Offline Connectivity: Through proprietary beacon transmission
        technology, APPIX ensured that large-scale audiences could receive
        time-sensitive content without dependence on traditional networks.
        Enhanced Engagement Strategies: Beyond technical capabilities, APPIX
        provided marketing and content strategy support to maximize adoption and
        participation rates.

        Hollywood Bowl leveraged APPIX for synchronized crowd lighting and
        interactive moments. Sports Arenas: The Cleveland Cavaliers integrated
        APPIX into their in-game experience, aligning crowd participation with
        stadium lighting and entertainment sequences. Safety & Public Events: At
        Tallmadge, Ohio’s massive community event, APPIX enhanced emergency
        communication protocols while engaging attendees. Theatrical & Broadcast
        Productions: Encanto Live at the Hollywood Bowl and the Tokyo 2020
        Olympics utilized APPIX to deliver seamless second-screen experiences to
