        <h3>Project Scope</h3>
      </div>
      <p>
        The enchanting world of Disney's "Encanto" came to life in a live
        performance at the iconic Hollywood Bowl. As the show was slated to be
        featured on Disney+, the stakes were high to ensure a flawless and
        immersive experience for both the in-person audience and viewers at
        home.
      </p>
      <p>
        With unreliable Wi-Fi and cellular connections at the Hollywood Bowl,
        traditional methods of crowd interaction and engagement would fall
        short. A unique solution was required to captivate the audience and
        enhance the production value for the Disney+ broadcast.

        <h3>Our Approach</h3>
      </div>
      <p>
        Capitalizing on its robust platform, APPIX was brought on board to
        orchestrate innovative crowd effects for the concert. Bypassing the need
        for Wi-Fi or cellular connections, APPIX's technology engaged the
        audience in real-time, making each individual a part of the show's magic
        and ensuring a cohesive, enhanced visual experience for the broadcast.
      </p>
      <p>
        The result was a mesmerizing integration of the audience into the
        storytelling of "Encanto," seamlessly complementing the on-stage
        performance. The APPIX-driven crowd effects not only intensified the
        live experience for attendees but also amplified the spectacle for
        Disney+ viewers.
      </p>
      <p>
        This successful collaboration reinforced APPIX's capability to elevate
        production standards, even in challenging environments, and now value
        proven for entertainment broadcasts by the global leader in
        entertainment and engaging audience experiences, Disney and DIsney+.
