        <h3>Project Scope</h3>
      </div>
      <p>
        In November 2019, Disney/Pixar and the Hollywood Bowl teamed up to
        deliver an unforgettable evening of live-to-film concert alchemy.
      </p>
      <p>
        Building on the relationship that was forged in 2018 with the 100th
        anniversary of the Los Angeles Philharmonic, Appix was approached to
        once again bring the magic of Appix Luminaire to the audience, as Disney
        and Pixarâ€™s Coco was brought to life on stage for the first time.
      </p>
      <p>
        Coco Live in Concert at the Hollywood Bowl transformed the legendary
        venue into the Land of the Dead, with Appix lighting an audience of
        18,000.

        <h3>Our Approach</h3>
      </div>
      <p>
        Working closely with Disney/Pixar and other key players, including the
        creative team projection mapping the bowl, the APPIX Live suite deployed
        an end-to-end production solution that was timed to the symphonic-visual
        presentation. Brilliantly emotive colours from phone displays, including
        time-synced phone flashes, lit up the bowl.
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition to the luminaire features of APPIX Live, APPIX provided full
        creative and marketing support that helped drive optimal engagement.
        Working closely with the production team on messaging for social media,
        email campaigns, and in-venue calls to action, every bridge was crossed
        to increase usership.
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition, to ensure the entire audience was able to participate in
        each special moment, APPIX provided an on-the-ground ambassador team
        located at each entrance and throughout the bowl to encourage attendees
        to download the app, and address any questions they may have.
