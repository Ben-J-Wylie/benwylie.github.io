        <h3>Project Scope</h3>
      </div>
      <p>
        In 2022, Highlands Church in Birmingham, Alabama, orchestrated an
        extraordinary live Christmas concert across 18 locations simultaneously.
        This massive production required seamless coordination to ensure a
        unified experience for all attendees, regardless of their location. To
        enhance audience engagement, APPIX was brought on board to provide
        synchronized second-screen content. This included: Supplementary video
        material Sing-along lyrics Important localized messaging Dynamic content
        synchronized with live talent features on stage This implementation
        ensured that every audience member across all 18 locations experienced a
        rich and immersive Christmas production.

        <h3>Our Approach</h3>
      </div>
      <p>
        Successfully deploying APPIX for this large-scale production required
        meticulous planning and collaboration with the Highlands Church
        production teams. Several key challenges had to be addressed: Ensuring
        FOH (Front of House) Connectivity: Each location had to be properly
        connected to its local APPIX server to ensure real-time content
        delivery. Cue Synchronization with Ableton Live: Each Highlands Church
        location triggered its respective cues using Ableton Live, making it
        crucial for APPIX to integrate seamlessly with this setup. Audience
        Content Pack Distribution: To ensure each attendee had access to the
        right content, a robust strategy was required to facilitate downloads of
        location-specific content packs. The success of this step was made
        possible through strong collaboration between APPIX and local production
        teams. Preventing WebSocket Cue Conflicts: With multiple locations
        operating simultaneously, it was critical to ensure that web socket cues
        from one venue did not interfere with another. This challenge was
        overcome, ensuring that each audience received the correct localized
        content at the right time. Through technical expertise and strategic
        collaboration, APPIX effectively synchronized the second-screen
        experience across all 18 locations without disruption.
