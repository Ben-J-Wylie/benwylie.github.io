        <h3>Project Scope</h3>
      </div>
      <p>
        In Tallmadge, Ohio, an annual community event has grown significantly,
        now outnumbering the city's population. The organizing committee, made
        up of public and private representatives, focuses on ensuring safety due
        to weather, lost children, and security concerns, including the
        possibility of an active shooter.
      </p>
      <p>
        To address these challenges, APPIX was brought on board early, going
        beyond APSA (Area Public Safety Alerts) to provide various additional
        features for public information, awareness and security. The APPIX
        platform operate without relying on cellular data or Wi-Fi, which is
        essential due to congestion issues at large gatherings such as this.

        <h3>Our Approach</h3>
      </div>
      <p>
        Already endorsed by the Event Safety Alliance, APPIX had established a
        strong foundation of trust with City Officials and Emergency Responders.
        Tallmadge also had a well-structured Public Health and Safety plan,
        including a full matrix, manual, and clear chain of command.
      </p>
      <p>
        With APSA, APPIX seamlessly integrated into this Emergency Operations
        Plan.
      </p>
      <p>
        Utilizing APPIX patented and patents pending ground-breaking
        transmission beacons along with the APPIX Anywhere solution, the
        deployment succeeded despite unusual site layout and challenging
        topography. APPIX's Bluetooth transmission covered over 1.25 kilometers
        from each unit, allowing unlimited users to receive crucial
        notifications instantly.
