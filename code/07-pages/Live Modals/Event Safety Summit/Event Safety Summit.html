        <h3>Project Scope</h3>
      </div>
      <p>
        The Event Safety Alliance has been making the world safer since 2012,
        and in 2019, from November 20th to 22nd, ESA held a three day symposium
        in Rock Lititz, PA dedicated to the ongoing education of live event
        industry professionals from across the world.
      </p>
      <p>
        APPIX was not only one of the honoured presenters, but the platform was
        adopted by the ESA as itâ€™s official app technology for event safety.
      </p>
      <p>
        For the duration of the three day forum, APPIX was tasked with keeping
        all attendees up-to-date with the cross campus, multi-venue conference
        scheduling, as well as ensuring the event was equipped and ready to
        handle campus communications in the event of a real emergency situation.

        <h3>Our Approach</h3>
      </div>
      <p>
        Working closely with the conference production team, APPIX was hands-on
        in mapping out the event schedule and helping to ensure that all
        attendees arrive at the breakout sessions they signed up for. The venue
        assignment was fluid. As such APPIX architected an event communications
        interface that was flexible enough to manage the one-the-fly
        requirements of the production team.
      </p>
      <p>
        APPIX deployed a campus-wide multi-antenna array that could reach every
        attendee 24/7 for real time scheduling, nuanced breakout session
        content, and emergency communications. All cues and communications were
        controlled from FOH (Front Of House) in the primary campus venue.
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition, during the APPIX presentation, an emergency power outage
        simulation was conducted that included campus-wide communications
        without the use of Wifi or cellular data, realtime venue map safe-exit
        directions, and ubiquitous smart phone flashlight illumination for
        individual sight visibility.
