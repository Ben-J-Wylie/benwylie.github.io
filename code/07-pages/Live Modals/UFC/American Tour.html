        <h3>Project Scope</h3>
      </div>
      <p>
        The UFC (Ultimate Fighting Championship) is a professional mixed martial
        arts (MMA) organization that promotes and hosts some of the world's top
        MMA fighters.
      </p>
      <p>
        During 2018 and 2019, Appix joined the UFC on their tour of the USA,
        providing their audience with an enhanced second-screen experience as
        the event unfolded live in front of them. APPIX was present with the UFC
        from Fight 227 to Fight 245.

        <h3>Our Approach</h3>
      </div>
      <p>
        Working closely with the event production team, APPIX was instrumental
        in bringing live statistics to the audienceâ€™s phones via the UFC
        proprietary Fightmetric API. Stats were integrated into the customized
        creative content for each event, and the show producer determined which
        creative/stats experience would be relevant for each moment during a
        fight.
      </p>
      <p>
        Additionally APPIX deployed an end-to-end production solution that was
        timed to various songs between matches. Brilliantly emotive colours from
        phone displays, including time-synced phone flashes , brought an extra
        level of spectacle to the event.
      </p>
      <p>
        APPIX deployed an antenna array suitable to cover each arena. All cues
        and communications were controlled from FOH (Front Of House).
