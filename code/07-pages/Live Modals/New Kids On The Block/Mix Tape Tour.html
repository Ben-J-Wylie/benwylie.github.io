        <h3>Project Scope</h3>
      </div>
      <p>
        The New Kids on the Block, a beloved boy-band from the 90s, continue to
        have a huge fan base. When they embarked on their first tour in years,
        NKOTB aimed to create a distinctive concert experience. They introduced
        a 'mix-tape' approach with supporting artists and a randomized song
        setlist, along with various engaging fan opportunities.
      </p>
      <p>Among these, APPIX stood out as the most significant success.</p>

        <h3>Our Approach</h3>
      </div>
      <p>
        In the realm of concerts, the challenge of maintaining cellular data and
        Wi-Fi connectivity is substantial. Enter the APPIX patented and
        patents-pending broadcast platform; an ideal solution to connect with
        unlimited fans within each venue, night after night.
      </p>
      <p>
        At every concert, for 52 performances, APPIX treated fans to an array of
        distinctive engagements. These included notifications and alerts on
        locked screens, as well as dynamic full-screen, full-color visuals and
        lively motion graphics, all impeccably synchronized with the music and
        spectacle the show became.
      </p>
      <p>
        By the tour's end, APPIX had not only surpassed all expectations,
        particularly in terms of audience adoption - often exceeding 50% - but
        NKOTB also successfully offset the entire APPIX cost. This was
        accomplished through a truly innovative, entirely new revenue-generating
        approach that the APPIX platform provides.
