        <h3>Project Scope</h3>
      </div>
      <p>
        For over 40 years, Herbalife has cemented its reputation as a global
        forerunner in nutrition. With a rich portfolio of products ranging from
        meal replacements to dietary supplements, they've touched lives in 95
        countries through a network of more than 6 million dedicated
        distributors or members.
      </p>
      <p>
        Every year, Herbalife celebrates its elite distributors with a luxurious
        three-day event in Los Angeles. With attendees hailing from various
        corners of the world, communicating event details, navigating the city,
        and catering to diverse linguistic needs posed a significant challenge.
      </p>
      <p>
        When Herbalife sought a solution for seamless communication, APPIX
        stepped in with its pioneering messaging service. Our goal was simple
        yet ambitious: Make the Herbalife LA extravaganza an unparalleled
        experience for every member attending.

        <h3>Our Approach</h3>
      </div>
      <p>
        Collaborating with Herbalife’s logistics and production teams, we
        designed bespoke messaging campaigns to cater to over fifty different
        groups, ensuring content relevance across a dozen languages.
      </p>
      <p>
        Throughout the event, we dispatched over 1300 messages. This included
        both pre-scheduled notifications and real-time messages, making sure
        attendees were always in the loop.
      </p>
      <p>
        All of this was made possible with APPIX’s robust, proprietary messaging
        platform. Whether it was guiding distributors through LA's landmarks or
        updating them about event schedules, our platform ensured timely and
        accurate communication.
