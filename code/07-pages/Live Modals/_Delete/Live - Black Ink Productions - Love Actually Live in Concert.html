        <h3>Project Scope</h3>
      </div>
      <p>
        In 2021, Black Ink Productions staged
        <strong>Love Actually - Live in Concert</strong>, a unique cinematic and
        orchestral experience that brought the beloved holiday film to life. The
        production featured a live orchestra performing the film’s score while
        the movie was projected on a large screen, immersing audiences in a
        multi-sensory spectacle.
      </p>
      <p>
        To elevate audience engagement, APPIX was commissioned to integrate a
        dynamic second-screen experience, providing rich media messaging cues
        before the show, during intermission, and after the performance.
        Additionally, APPIX was tasked with ensuring real-time execution of cues
        despite significant logistical and budgetary constraints due to the
        COVID-19 pandemic.

        <h3>Our Approach</h3>
      </div>
      <p>
        Given the challenges presented by the pandemic and financial
        constraints, APPIX implemented an innovative remote-controlled
        deployment strategy. For the first time in its history, APPIX executed
        all cue activations remotely from Vancouver, Canada, eliminating the
        need for on-site hardware.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Key technological solutions included:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <p>
          <li>
            <strong>Remote Cue Execution:</strong> All APPIX cues were triggered
            remotely via a secure connection, ensuring a seamless integration
            with the live performance.
          </li>
        </p>
        <p>
          <li>
            <strong>Unity ClearCom Integration:</strong> A direct communication
            link was established between APPIX's remote operator and the stage
            manager through Unity ClearCom, allowing precise synchronization
            with live cue calls.
          </li>
        </p>
        <p>
          <li>
            <strong>WebSocket Transmission:</strong> Rather than using
            traditional broadcast antenna hardware, all cues were transmitted to
            the on-site audience through WebSocket technology, providing a
            reliable and low-latency experience.
          </li>
        </p>
        <p>
          <li>
            <strong>Pre-Show, Intermission, and Post-Show Engagement:</strong>
            Media-rich messaging was delivered to enhance audience interaction
            and engagement throughout the event.
