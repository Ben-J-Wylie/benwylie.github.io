        <h3>Project Scope</h3>
      </div>
      <p>
        In 2018, the Los Angeles Philharmonic celebrated its 100th anniversary
        with a grand event at the Hollywood Bowl, one of the most iconic venues
        in the world. The night featured performances by an extraordinary lineup
        of artists, including Katy Perry, Herbie Hancock, and John Williams,
        each sharing the stage with the LA Philharmonic. The Hollywood Bowl's
        massive proscenium was illuminated with mesmerizing media content,
        providing a visually stunning backdrop for the event. APPIX was brought
        in to enhance the audience experience, delivering synchronized
        second-screen content and immersive flash luminaire effects that would
        bring the audience into the heart of the celebration.

        <h3>Our Approach</h3>
      </div>
      <p>
        To create a seamless and engaging experience, APPIX implemented a
        strategic plan: Broadcast Hardware Installation: APPIX deployed its
        proprietary broadcast technology at the Hollywood Bowl to ensure
        consistent and reliable engagement throughout the venue. Real-Time Show
        Integration: APPIX functioned as a full-fledged production department,
        with an on-site operator integrated into the production team via
        ClearCom. This ensured that all phone content cues were executed in
        perfect sync with the live performances. Audience Participation
        Strategy: To maximize user adoption, APPIX ambassadors were stationed at
        venue entrances to inform and educate attendees as they arrived.
        Additionally, printed materials with instructions were placed on every
        seat. Interactive Audience Activation: The event’s on-stage MC guided
        the audience through the APPIX experience, including an audience-wide
        test activation. The collective gasp of amazement from attendees
        confirmed the immediate impact of the technology.
